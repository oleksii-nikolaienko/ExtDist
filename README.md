A consistent, unified and extensible framework for estimation of parameters for probability distributions, including parameter estimation procedures that allow for weighted samples; the current set of distributions included are: the standard beta, The four-parameter beta, Burr, gamma, Gumbel, Johnson SB and SU, Laplace, logistic, normal, symmetric truncated normal, truncated normal, symmetric-reflected truncated beta, standard symmetric-reflected truncated beta, triangular, uniform, and Weibull distributions; decision criteria and selections based on these decision criteria.
